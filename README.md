## Overview
This project provides a starting point for your Ember apps with Express web framework serving as a RESTful API  back-end. Directory structure is heavily influenced by [ember-tools](https://github.com/rpflorence/ember-tools) and [Ember App Kit](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit). In fact it is designed to work with ember-tools for quickly scaffolding models, views, template, routes and controllers. Here is an example from ember-tools's github page:

Thanks to Ember's *Convention-over-Configuration* we are quickly able to generate application files with a simple command. That is a huge time saver in the long run.


<hr />
**Versions:** Ember 1.3, Ember Data 1.0b5, Handlebars 1.1.2, jQuery 2.0.3
<hr />

## Prerequisites
- Node.js `http://nodejs.org`
- MongoDB `brew install mongodb`
- ember-tools: `sudo npm install -g ember-tools`

## Usage
Click on **Download ZIP** button in the right sidebar.
Extract and navigate to the directory in terminal. Then to install all the dependencies run:
```
npm install
```
To start a web server, run `node app.js`. **Note**: MongoDB must be running or else the server won't start. Then visit `http://localhost:3000`. There are no server-side views, thus you will not see `res.render` anywhere in the code. The `index.html` is loaded implicitly from the `/public` folder. And `index.html` in turn loads the entire Ember application.

Updating *.scss stylesheets will automatically result in generating a proper css file, as long as the Express server is running. This ability is provided by the `node-sass` library.

For Ember source files you will use **ember-tools** to build and watch for file changes. Simply run `ember build` in the project root directory to compile all javascript files into `application.js`. If you want ember-tools to automatically run build command when files change, run `ember build -w`. Simple as that.

To recap: Make sure MognoDB is running. Run `node app.js`. Then in a separate terminal tab run `ember build -w`. And you are all set.

For generating models, views, controllers, templates, routes please refer to ember-tools [github page](https://github.com/rpflorence/ember-tools).

## TODO
- ~~Authentication (Local)~~
- Improve security of token-based authentication
- Facebook Oauth2 via ember-simple-auth
- ~~Express Middleware~~
- Offline.js plugin for notifying user when they are offline
- Notification when server is taking too long to respond
- Youtube-like AJAX loading animation
- ~~Bootstrap navbar~~
- QUnit Ember tests
- Display an alert message on login/singup request timeout
- ~~Bootstrap Sticky Footer~~
- Ember-validations for client validations
- Express-validator for server validations
- User OR email sign in (passport-local config)
- Passport-local vs token-based approach with no sessions
- Change `people` model to posts to avoid confusion with `user` model

## Tests
There are currently no actual Ember tests, but I plan to add QUnit tests in the future. Why QUnit and not Mocha or Jasmine? QUnit is the default testing framework in Ember, and I have no preference for any testing framework, so I chose to stick with the defaults. But of course feel free to swap it for something else.

## Contributing
Please feel free to submit a bug, propose an enhancement, send pull requests. This project is definitely not set in stone, and I plan to keep always improving it as I learn better practices from Ember and Node.js communities.
